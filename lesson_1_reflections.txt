How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It made it clear to the developer to witness the steps he made and get a glance of what went wrong where.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It helps me get more insight of what changed and how things evaluated from my previous versions to the current one.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Saving multiple files in one commit allows the developer to be aware of changed made in the same time from the log.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
We can use them to access the history of files, get special ids of them and run them in comparison with git diff to see how the history changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
As I have the power to restore history and make test which commit broke it and which can get it on the right track again.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
